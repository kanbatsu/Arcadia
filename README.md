#Arcadia

Welcome on the repository of my project, called Arcadia.

It's a project, to help filmmaker friend, making a Netflix-like interface for his projects.

It's made with VueJS, still under construction, but some main features are already working.

To make this project run, you'll have to edit somes parts, especially the path to vue.js, and of course fill the video and img folders.

Have fun !

##Next to come
Here is the list of features that will come as soon as I'll have time to :
* API integration
* Audio tracks working
* User interface, with registered account
* and many more ...!
